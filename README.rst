Python Libraries for HAWK
==========================

[Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk) is an HTTP authentication scheme using a message authentication code (MAC) algorithm to provide partial HTTP request cryptographic verification.

PyHawk is great for consuming or providing webservices form Python.

Status
------

This is under development, not ready for primetime.
There doesn't appear to be a Python library for HAWK.
Let me know if there is already a robust library.

Development
-----------

The `tests/server` directory has a server.js and a client.js (Node code) which are from HAWK's usage.js.

Plan
----

Iterate on a python library until it can communicate with the test client/server.

Server first, client second.
